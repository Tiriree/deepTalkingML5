Machine Learning Bot. I uses machine learning algorithms to generate itâ€™s understanding model.
For this code, I used pre-train word (wordvecs10000) to train it. The bot will respond with related words from the pre-train file.

You can also Train with other source texts to make them produce difference contexts. 

You can use Shiffman's example for training your data 
[word2vec-Train](https://github.com/shiffman/p5-word2vec/tree/master/train)
