This is one type of the bots I created, Machine Learning Bot. I uses ML5 algorithms to generate itâ€™s understanding model.
For this example, I used pre-train word (wordvecs10000) to train it. The bot will respond with related words from the pre-train file.

You can also Train with other source texts to make them produce difference contexts. 

For example, In my show, I used Phantom of the opera script to train it. The bot will respond with related words from the phantom the opera.

I used Shiffman's example for training your data
